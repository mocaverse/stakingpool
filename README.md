# Problems

## LZ

- blocking or nonblocking
- what if txn fails on dstChain: failure remedy, mitigation, automatic relies
- V1 vs/or V2
- which V2 lib/repo?
- postdeployment: monitoring dashboard where we can track metrics, health of system and so forth.

## Vault creation period

120 days from deployment vaults can be created.
lastDay = startDate + 120 days.
vault creation check: if vaultStart + duration exceed lastDay, reject creation
